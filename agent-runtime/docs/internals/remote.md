# Remote architecture

Each connection joins a client to one environment over HTTP and WebSocket. The
environment owns providers, execution, files, and durable state. Direct access,
Tailscale, and Remote connections change how the client reaches that server; they do
not introduce another execution model. See
[remote access](../user/remote-access.md) for setup.

## Identity is independent of the route

An environment keeps its ID across server restarts and endpoint changes. Saved
connections are local to a client profile; the server's identity and state are
not. A repository identity can correlate clones across environments, but never
routes work between them. A project and its threads belong to one environment.

[Environment ID initialization](../../apps/server/src/environment/ServerEnvironment.ts)
must publish a complete ID atomically. Repair of an empty ID file retains a
recovery file so concurrent or delayed initializers choose the same winner.
Removing that recovery state as ordinary temporary-file cleanup can change the
identity underneath an already-running server.

Advertised endpoints are reachability hints. Only the connecting device can
prove that a route works. In particular, a host's loopback address refers to a
different machine when another device opens it. Endpoint selection must not
silently fall back to loopback when a shareable endpoint is unavailable.

## Pairing URLs

A pairing URL carries the pairing secret in its fragment, which stays out of
requests to the serving origin. The browser exchanges the secret with the
environment and strips it from its history. Moving the token into a query
parameter would disclose it to the wrong origin.

Clients generate direct pairing URLs on the environment's own origin. A
[`/pair?host=` URL](../../apps/web/src/hostedPairing.ts) instead names the backend
in its query; web and mobile clients still accept that form when it is opened
or pasted.

## Access and process ownership are different

Tailscale supplies an endpoint for ordinary pairing, so it needs no separate
environment type. Authentication remains the environment's responsibility for
every route. See [environment authentication](./environment-auth.md) .

Remote servers can outlive several client releases. Clients must use advertised
capabilities and handle their absence, rather than assume their own version
describes the server. Process replacement belongs to the launcher's
[update protocol](./server-updates.md); the connection runtime handles the
resulting disconnect.

### Desktop without a local environment

Desktop normally launches its own primary server, but the desktop setting `localEnvironmentEnabled`
(`apps/desktop/src/settings/DesktopAppSettings.ts`) turns that off. Changing it relaunches the app;
no local state is deleted. On the next start the main process skips port selection, server exposure,
and the primary backend, and opens the window right away. The renderer sees this through
`desktopBridge.getLocalEnvironmentEnabled()`: `readPrimaryEnvironmentTarget` returns null, so primary
auth and platform-managed discovery are skipped and only saved environments (pairing, relay)
connect. This is possible because the desktop renderer is not served by the backend: the `t3code://`
scheme serves the bundled client from disk (Vite in development) and API traffic always goes to the
environment's own URL.
