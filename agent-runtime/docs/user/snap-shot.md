# SnapShots

A SnapShot captures the window you are working in and attaches it to your current draft. The
attachment carries the app name and window title, and when available the app icon and the window's
accessibility data (its controls, text, and their positions in the image). Agents can use that data
to reason about the screenshot.

SnapShots are off by default and available in the macOS desktop app.

## Turning it on

Open **Settings** > **SnapShots** and turn the feature on. Setup has two steps: allow capture, then
choose a shortcut. **Finish later** turns capture back off, so you can resume where you left off.

Setup asks for Screen Recording. It asks for Accessibility only when **Include app text** is on.

Turning capture off releases the shortcut.

## Taking a capture

Switch to the window you want and press the shortcut. The default is both Shift keys together. Cinderdeck attaches the image to your draft and brings itself forward. If no thread
is open it starts a draft in the current project.

Pressing the shortcut while Cinderdeck is in front captures Cinderdeck itself.

Pending captures are kept on disk until the attachment is saved to the draft, so a capture survives
closing the app mid-way and is attached on the next launch. Captures rejected because the image is
too large are discarded.

## Changing the shortcut

Select the shortcut in Settings, press the new keys, then **Save**. You can use a modifier pair such
as Command+Command or Control+Control, or a key chord. Cinderdeck refuses shortcuts that collide with
its own keybindings or that macOS already reserves.

## Include app text

**Include app text** controls whether captures include the window's accessibility data. Turn it off
to attach screenshots only. This also drops the Accessibility permission requirement.

Availability depends on the app. Some apps expose only their window controls, not the document or
terminal contents. If an app is slow to answer, Cinderdeck attaches the screenshot without the data
rather than waiting.

An icon beside the app name on an attachment shows whether accessibility data was included. Select
it to inspect what was captured.

## Sound, flash, and animation

Settings controls the capture sound, the brief flash on the captured window, and the animation that
flies the image into your draft. Each can be turned off independently. The operating system's
reduced-motion setting also disables the animation.
